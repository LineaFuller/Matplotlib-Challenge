Analyzed data from Pymaceuticals most recent animal study to compare the performace of the anti-cancer drug, Capomulin against other regimens. The study included 249 mice identified with squamous cell carcinoma tumor growth and treated with an array of drug regimens. The tumor volume was tracked over a period of 45 days.

## Results
According to the results Capomulin effictively decreased the tumor volume. Capomulin kept the most of its testing subjects alive for the full duration of the experiment compared to its competitors. Over the course of 45 days it decreased Mouse s185's tumor from 45 mm3 to 25 mm3. Whereas, Infubinol and Ceftamin appeared to accelerate tumor growth. In addition, the weight of the mouse subject and tumor size was compared to study potential factors  that effect the size of a tumor. There is a strong positve correlation between weight and tumor size as observed from the scatter plot and confirmed by the correlation coefficient calculation. All in all, Capomulin successfully kept mice diagnosed with SSC alive and decreased the tumor size compared to Infubinol and Ceftamin. Ramicane produced similar results to Capomulin and it'd be in Pymaceuticals beest interest to conduct further studys comparing the two.
